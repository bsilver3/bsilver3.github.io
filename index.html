        Recall that incredibly focused moment, during the final moments of a project, test, or deadline. 
        The analog clock just out of your vision silently ticks away, reminding you to focus, 
        although you don’t know how much time remains. You are “locked in”. Nothing can interrupt your intense focus. 
        However, without the audible rhythm of the clock ticking, you quickly shift your attention to the clock to check how much time is left. 
        Wait- what!? It looked like the second hand stopped for a bit!?
      </p>

      <p>
        That brief moment when time seems to stretch, and you're left wondering if reality just hit a pause button – 
        <span class="magic-text">that's chronostasis at play. </span><br>
        It's like a magic trick your brain pulls when you're laser-focused on something, 
        and then, surprise, a new thing pops up.
      </p>

      <p>
        Imagine your eyes doing a quick dance between two points – that's called a <span class="glow-text">saccadic eye movement. </span>
        When locking on the new surprise object after that quick saccadic eye dance, 
        your brain subtly distorts your perception, which tricks you into thinking the surprise lasted longer than it actually did. 
        Think about how someone might get dizzy after spinning around.
      </p>

      <p>
        Now, here's the intriguing part that keeps me hooked: how often does this time-bending magic unfold in our daily lives, 
        and what role does the speed of our saccadic eye dance play in the enchantment of chronostasis? 
        Join me on this journey as we unravel the secrets behind this captivating illusion and discover the hidden rhythms of time in the everyday.

      <p>
        Chronostasis is a phenomenon where it feels like you are “stopped in time”. 
        This generally occurs when your brain has to overcorrect after an eye movement.
      </p>
        When analyzing the data, we can see that there is a positive association between velocity and amplitude, 
        meaning that the faster somebody moves their eye, the more likely they are to experience a chronostasis phenomenon, 
        due to their eye using more force and having to overcorrect.
      <p>
        I calculated the amount of people with an amplitude above 20.0, 
        which is the amplitude that it generally takes to have a substantial amount of correction in the brain. 
        I then calculated the percentage of people who had the experience of chronostasis, 
        and I found that in 1.84% of saccadic eye movements, chronostasis occurred.
      </p>
      <p>
        However, this can easily be manipulated by intensely focusing on a point, and then quickly shifting your focus to another object, 
        such as a clock. If the second hand seems to freeze for a second, then you have experienced a form of chronostasis.
